In this project, I've implemented a hash set data structure in C++. The core of the hash set consists of an array of linked list pointers, where each element of the array holds a pointer to a linked list. The hash set also tracks its size and load factor, recalculating the latter after each successful insert operation. The HashSet class, declared in hashset.h, provides various functions for initializing, inserting, removing, checking for item existence, retrieving the number of items, and more. Additionally, a Makefile is included to build static and shared libraries, run tests, and clean up build artifacts. Five additional tests have been written in tests/test.cpp to ensure the functionality of the hash set implementation.
