In this project, I've developed a custom 'my_which' program that emulates the standard 'which' program's functionality. 'my_which' searches through the PATH variable to locate directories containing target executable files, handling flags, checking file existence, and providing appropriate output, ensuring it behaves just like the standard 'which' program.
